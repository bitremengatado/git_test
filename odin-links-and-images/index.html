        <h1>Learning HTML in 2025</h1>
        <p>
            I'm using this document both as a method of tracking my progress
            and revisiting what I've learned with the Odin Project.
        </p>
        <h2>Semantics</h2>
        <p>
            At this point I'm pretty comfortable with creating text pages.
            I understand many <em>elements</em> and <strong>how to use them</strong>.
            Also, why use them in the first place or over other elements.
            For example why use the element "strong" over "b" even though they both make the text bold.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand the purpose and idea of marking and indentations in the code.
            The way they distingush parent and child elements is clear to me.
        </p>
        <h3>The steps I took in learning what I know now</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How to make a HTML document</li>
            <li>How to create and apply correctly</li>
            <li>How to organize elements in a readable manner</li>
            <li>How to link other pages and images</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
                <li>Understanding of the href and src attributes</li>
                <li>Knowledge about targeting and security precautions</li>
                <li>Understanding of absolute and relative paths</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How to <em>mix and match</em> <strong><em>various</em></strong> elements
                with the purpose of semantic clarity.<sup><sup>also looks very cute!</sup></sup>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Linking</h2>
        <p>
        I'm still learning about <a href="./images/link.png">link</a>.
        At this moment I feel like I grasp the concept and can execute it comfortably
        but still would take a little bit more practice to become second nature.
        In the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odin Project</a> curriculum they suggest we do an "about page".
        So I'll introduce my progress in that way:
        </p>
