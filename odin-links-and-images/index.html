        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About the Odin Project</a>
  <p>
    This action was done by wrapping the message around an achor, the "a" element.
    The element is followed by the "href" comment, which let's you turn the text content
    into a hyperlink, highlighted by underline and the blue color.
  </p>
  <p>Notice how the link opened in the same tab. That happened because the browser
    doesn't have a specified target, so it defaults to itself. Let's try something else then</p>
    <a href="https://www.pudim.com.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This link will open a new tab</a>
  <p>
    This anchor element not only had the "href" comment but also the "target" one.
    <em>"Target"</em> let's you dictate where the browser will open the new tab.
    You could write "_self", but the browser defaults to if if no other target is specified.
    In this case, we used the "_blank" target to redirect to a new, blank page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also worth noting. Although impossible to notice without opening console, this example
    also had a "rel" attribute. "rel" describes the relation between the current page and linked doc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h6>Here's the values added to "rel":</h6>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>noopener:</strong>ensure the new tab cannot interact or access the original page.
        It adds security because, without it, the new page could use of JavaScript to manipulate yours.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>noreferrer:</strong>prevents the new tab from knowing where the user is coming from
            ensuring privacy.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Theoretically, "noreferrer" also has "noopener" properties. By not knowing where the user is coming from (privacy)
    the new page also won't be able to use JavaScript to access it (security). However, using both is a good security measure
    because the new page could still manipulate the previous tab to change to a new webpage, tricking users.
  </p>
  <p>Nowadays, browsers are so safety oriented they might still provide security if "target=_blank" is present, even if you forget the "rel" attribute. Still, always great to err in the side of caution and pair them up!</p>

  <h2>Absolute and Relative links</h2>
  <p>
    We've done a lot of <em>absolute</em> linking for now. That means we've used the exact path to reach another page.
    An absolute link looks like this <strong>scheme://domain/path</strong>. For example:
    <ul>
        <li>scheme: https</li>
        <li>domain: theodinproject.com</li>
        <li>path: about</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>That's not the only way to link something. Introducing: <em>relative links.</em></p>
  <p>
    Relative links don't need the domain to be reached. That's because it's used to link pages within the same <strong>website</strong>.
    Since both pages are in the same place, it's assumed the same domain is used.
  </p>
  <p>Relative pages only include the path <em>relative</em> to the page you're creating the link on.</p>
  <p>
    If the target page is in the same folder you could literally just tell the browser the "href" is the file itself.
    In our case it isn't. There's a folder called "pages" in the same folder as this page, index.html - inside the pages folder there's a file named "about.html"
    To reach it, let's use the location <em>relative</em> to the page we're in right now. that would be:
  </p>
  <p><h3>./pages/about.html</h3></p>
  <p>"./" tells the browser to look around the folder it already is.<br>
     "/pages" is where our link is located.<br>
     "about.html" is our link! Put it all together and it looks something a little like this:
  </p>


    <a href="./pages/about.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About page</a></p>

 <p><h2>Images and Photos</h2></p>
 <p>
    HTML is also able to link to pictures! Instead of using anchor elements we're going to use an image element.
    The image element "img" is a <em>void element</em>, which means it doesn't wrap around content like most others.
    Instead it executes it's purpose by itself or with the help of some attributes.<br>
    In this case we're going to use it along the <em>source attribute</em> or "src", as it likes to be called.
    src works much like href. It needs a path that can be either absolute or relative. In this example we're going to use a relative path.
